**CzechFOI MEAN** is a solution for analyzing, calculating, and visualizing FOI (Freedom of Information) data efficiently. <br>It's faster and more flexible than using spreadsheets but requires some IT knowledge.

The [Python Scripts](https://github.com/gitfrid/CzechFOI-DA/tree/main/Py%20Scripts) process and visualize CSV data from the [TERRA folder](https://github.com/gitfrid/CzechFOI-MEAN/tree/main/TERRA), generating interactive HTML plots. 

Dates are counted as the number of days since [January 1, 2020](https://github.com/gitfrid/CzechFOI-MEAN/blob/main/Plot%20Results/Days%20to%20Date%20Translation%20Day%20Date%20Translation/Days%20to%20Date%20Translation%20Day%20Date%20Translation.png), for easier processing. "AGE_2023" represents age on January 1, 2023.

Access the original Czech FOI data from a [Freedom of Information request](https://github.com/PalackyUniversity/uzis-data-analysis/blob/main/data/Vesely_106_202403141131.tar.xz).
